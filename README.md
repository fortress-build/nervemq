A lightweight, SQLite-backed message queue with AWS SQS-compatible API, written in Rust.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in development and has not been tested in production scenarios.

## Features

- üöÄ **AWS SQS Compatible API** - Drop-in replacement for applications using AWS SQS
- üíæ **SQLite Backend** - Reliable, embedded storage with ACID guarantees
- üîí **Multi-tenant** - Namespace isolation with built-in authentication
- üìä **Queue Attributes** - Track message counts, timestamps, and queue settings
- üèÉ **Fast & Efficient** - Written in Rust for optimal performance
- üéØ **Self-contained** - Self-contained binary with minimal requirements
- üì± Admin Interface - Manage queues and tenants via UI or API

## Installation / Quick Start

NerveMQ is intended to be modular and extensible. As such, it can be consumed in two ways: using
the preconfigured binary in `main.rs`, or including `nervemq` as a library and providing the custom
implementations needed for your use-case. We also plan to add more configuration options to the preconfigured
binary so that common use-cases are covered.

For now, you will have to clone the repo from github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fortress-build/nervemq
cd nervemq
cargo run --release
```

The server expects a few configuration parameters to be available via
environment variables:

- `NERVEMQ_DB_PATH` (optional; default: `./nervemq.db`)
  Database file path

- `NERVEMQ_DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES` (optional; default: `10`)
  Default retry limit

- `NERVEMQ_HOST` (optional; default `http://localhost:8080`)
  Server host URL (for UI access)

- `NERVEMQ_ROOT_EMAIL` (optional; default `admin@example.com`)
  Root admin email

- `NERVEMQ_ROOT_PASSWORD` (optional; default `password`)
  Root admin password

The server doesn't have any subcommands or CLI interface. Just run `nervemq` to start.

To use the UI (for now) you must clone the git repo and run the nextjs app manually. We may make a hosted version
available in the future or rework the webapp to be bundled statically and served by the server as well.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fortress-build/nervemq
cd nervemq
bun run start # node and deno should work here too :)
```

## Usage Examples

NerveMQ's queue APIs are compatible with SQS, so you can you any SQS client.

### Using AWS SDK

```rust
use aws_sdk_sqs::{Client, Config};

async fn example() {
    let config = Config::builder()
        .endpoint_url("http://localhost:8080/sqs")
        .build();

    let client = Client::from_conf(config);

    // Send a message
    client.send_message()
        .queue_url("http://localhost:8080/namespace/myqueue")
        .message_body("Hello World!")
        .send()
        .await?;
}
```

## Admin API

TODO: Document the admin API

## Why NerveMQ?

- **Simple Deployment**: Single binary, no external dependencies
- **Familiar API**: AWS SQS compatibility means easy migration
- **Reliable Storage**: SQLite provides robust data persistence
- **Cost Effective**: Self-hosted alternative to cloud services
- **Developer Friendly**: Easy to set up for development and testing

## Architecture

NerveMQ uses SQLite as its storage engine, providing:

- ACID compliance
- Reliable message delivery
- Efficient queue operations
- Data durability
- Low maintenance overhead
